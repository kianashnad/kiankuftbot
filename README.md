# Kian O'Kuft

A funny telegram bot to mention me in telegram when someone calls my name in an specific telegram group :))

## Usage

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a telegram bot using the `@BotFather` Bot and get the bot token.
4. prepare the .env file and place the telegram bot token, telegram UUID, and the rest of ENV variables.
5. make sure that you seprated the the array ENVs by a comma (`,`) and there's no space before or after the commas.
6. run `yarn start`

also Nodemon is configured for local development, run by `yarn dev`

## Important points

- You can deploy it via docker and docker and docker compose as well.
- In the `docker-compose.yml` file, the resource usage is limited to these:
   ```
  cpus: '0.100'
  memory: 500M
  ```
  change them if you desire to.

- Feel free to improve the project with a PR
- You're welcome to email me if I've had a mistake.
